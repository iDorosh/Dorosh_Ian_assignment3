<p>In my story I simplified the basic rocket launch to fit the flow chart as best I could. Getting user information about when to launch the rocket and the wind conditions allowed me to calculate the amount of seconds to add to the count down and how much money to spend on fuel.I have decided to use the same story I had in project 2 so I can expand on it further.</p>
<p>In this version I added rocket separation and the names of the astronauts taken from the json file. Now there is a little more detail in my story. I have also included an array of rocket names that will be detached from the main ship during launch and used a array property to display the amount of rockets that the ship carries.  </p>
